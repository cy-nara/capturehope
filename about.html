            <h1>Welcome to capTure</h1>     
            <p>Substance use disorder (SUD) is a pandemic, infiltrating the very core of our society by etching 
                deep scars on individuals, families, and societies. Only 15-20% of individuals stay abstinent one 
                year after treatment, with relapse rates as high as 85%. Meet capTure: a revolutionary tool 
                designed to empower individuals to embrace growth and make lasting, positive lifestyle changes. 
                <br><br> By tapping into relative emotional triggers and brain wave patterns, our product helps users 
                identify alarming data to prevent further substance use. capTure’s mobile app, ‘capTure.com’, 
                seamlessly integrates advanced brain wave analysis to track and monitor users’ unique emotional 
                and behavioral patterns, identifying early indicators of relapse. Our artificial intelligence 
                extracts and relays critical data to healthcare professionals and loved ones while simultaneously 
                offering personalized resources for maintaining abstinence. <br><br>To avoid social stigmatization, 
                wireless EEG biosensors are embedded in a baseball cap to promote continuous use without individuals 
                being defined by their condition. We employ a one-time cost for the designed cap with an additional monthly 
                subscription accounting for the biosensor primer fluid and the in-app data processing software. capTure 
                builds a stepping stone for victims of this pandemic, taking control of their journey and creating a 
                healthier, more fulfilling life.

<p>capTure’s performance relies on its Brain-Computer Interface design and wireless EEG biosensor 
    electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, F7, F8, F3, F4, and Pz), which measure potential differences using 
    differential amplifiers and a mastoid reference electrode. A primer fluid is applied to lower 
    electrode impedance for optimal signal quality, while the cap is designed for discreet, all-day use without drawing attention.</p>
